            <p>Eva:
                5.0 out of 5 stars, Hair transformation!

                I just HAVE to leave a review for this product!
                I got the shampoo & conditioner set about a week ago...& while, yes, it does seem to have a more potent scent after rinsing out than other shampoos & conditioners I have tried,
                it has helped my hair tremendously! Before using this set & for many dry winter months, whenever I would run my fingers through my hair
                I would hear "SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!" I've only been using this duo for a week & find my hair to feel & be much healthier than with the
                $70 shampoo & conditioner set I got not long ago...this is the best value for your money.
                I wash my hair every 3-4 days & still feel the softness & moisture that it's provided on wash day by day 4.
                I don't think I'll be using anything else from now on; this stuff is amazing!!! </p>
