    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>After being a cs major for a semester, we started to get sick of the stinky cs majors who donâ€™t wanna shower.
        We started to wonder why they wouldn't, but then we wondered, why couldnâ€™t they.
        We realized that it might be because they are too busy or lazy to find the quality hygiene products they need cheap, and fast.
        So we made a website to streamline the research process of these hygiene products to make it easier and more accessible to busy college students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harr, we are legendary pirates and have found the One Piece: a bottle of shampoo.
        After sailing for two decades, we decided to use this legendary treaure to do an activity called showering.
        We never showered when we were out in the seas.
